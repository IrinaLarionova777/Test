 ; The output uses HTML as I want to keep control of the formatting and font Sizes.
 ; To use HTML the MIME stuff is necessary.
 ; You will probably find that the output varies according to the program used to view the e-mail.
 ; Outlook is subtly different from Outlook express.
 ; This code has been written with OE in mind.
 ; Some of this code has been cribbed from CSP.
 ; Later versions of Cache provide integral support for MIME, auto emailing etc so in the future
 ; it will be possible to replace this code with calls to Intersystems functions.
